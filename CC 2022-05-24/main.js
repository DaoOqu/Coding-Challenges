// Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

// Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
// Output: [1,2]

// Input: nums = [1], k = 1
// Output: [1]

// will always have at least one element?
// will they always be integers?
// are we returning the integer that comes up a 'k' number of times? or
// are we returning the 'k' most elements that come up the most frequently?
// will we see integers that come up the same amount of times? and will we have to choose one over the other?
